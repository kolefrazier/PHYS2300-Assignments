When increasing Earth's velocity (in the 2-body) to 35 km/s, the orbit becomes more lopsided, with the Sun being off-center.

When the time step is much smaller than necessary, the simulation takes forever to display anything (due to there being extremely small changes).

When the time step is much too large, the simulation breaks. The changes are too drastic, so any movement is linear rather than following a curve. This creates straight lines (one axis of movement or not normal behavior) in the simulation's display.
