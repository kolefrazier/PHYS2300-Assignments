Orbits are more or less created by "kicking" the objects (setting initial velocities) in opposite directions.

AU = astronical unit. This represents the distance between the Sun and Moon.
AU/day = 1.5x10^11 (I think that was right?)

Shitty visual:
	(1)			(2)
  V1: 5 m/s   V2: -5 m/s
  
 
F and R are vectors in the following.
	F(1,2) = F(1) - F(2)
	
	|F(1,2)| = (G*m(1)*m(2))/(|R(1,2)|^2)
	Which breaks down further into:
	X = (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2
	sqrt(X) = |R(1,2)|
	
There will be a wobble to the sun's travels (like a super tight spiral) due to the Earth's gravitational pull on it.

This is due to centering things on the Sun's frame, rather than the center of mass between the Sun and Earth.

To correct this wobble, we need to adjust for center of mass.
	See the "MX" equation in the assignment file, Page 4.
	
	
Game Plan:
	1. Design a two planet system.
	2. Calculate center of mass.
	3. Add extra planets.
	4. (To do later) Leap frog integrator.
	
	
Scaling
	So, multiply the 
	We want the distance to be proportional, but planets have to be scaled to be visible.
