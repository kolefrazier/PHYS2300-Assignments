1. Scientific Question
	Can we use data to show something?
	Recall the examples given in class: 
		Is winter (first freeze and first thaw dates) one month longer than it was in 1940?
		Population Explosion: How many people would you have to move off-world to keep the population from rising?
	Questions do NOT have to be "able" to do in real life (such as measuring temperature in the center of the sun)
	We want something that isn't too complex (eg Takes 5 years to run) or too simple (eg Takes 30 seconds to run)
	
2. Computational Element
	We need to compute something.
	This can be theoretical or data analysis.
	
3. Result
	Display the result in a way that can help you analyze the element or display a definite result.
