----- Climate -> Winter -----
 Is winter arriving sooner or later? Is it leaving sooner or later?
	Particularly when compared to previous decades?


----- liquid heat transfer ------

how different liquids conduct heat over time
	finding a liquid to cool things quickest
	does it "peak" at a certain point?
	how does it change based on volume, liquid type and initial temperatures (heated element and liquid temps)

----- Other Ideas -----
Erosion?
The water one (the TDSE file?) with water fractals and vortices

Other: Why do they use lead shields for xrays? Why not other metals?

----- Water and Reflections and Heat-----
using waterWorldPseudo.py

Changing to better fit for a final project:
	Include an atmosphere and land masses
	Note the changes in albedo (reflectivity scale?) as the surface changes.
		Ex: Water has albedo=0.3, ice has albedo=0.9

----- Solar Winds -----
Does solar wind effect orbits?
	Orbits of moons around planets without a magnetosphere(name? The protective sphere) or atmosphere?
	What about comets without these planetary protections?

------ Light Travel -----
If light were to leave the universe in a curved trajectory, could it ever return to earth, allowing us to see Earth as it were in the past?
